		<strong>PREAMBLE</strong>

		<br>
		<br>

		The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspiration, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.
		<br>
		Software engineers shakll commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing, and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to health, safety, and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following eight Principles:
